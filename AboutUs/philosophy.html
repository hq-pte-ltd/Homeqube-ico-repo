        The proverbial saying “Modern problems require modern solutions” is a fitting description for 21st-century innovations. But this can be a hit-or-miss, with the shock value of unveiling an innovation not enough to guarantee its success. 

        <br>
        <br>
        By looking into the philosophies behind successful creative solutions, Homeqube has unraveled a working formula for a good technological innovation: deconstruction, decentralization, and democratization.

        Deconstructing systems

            The idea of destruction is often seen as a negative event, connoting the death of preestablished structures. A destruction of a building entails the loss of all resources, planning, and efforts that were put into the very act of building it. It is perceived as the direct antagonist of creation. 
<br>
<br>
Similarly, the destruction of natural resources prompted the emergence of climate change. 
<br>
<br>
Destruction, generally speaking, can be catastrophic. But perhaps this manner of thinking is simply a product of convention and could, in principle, be unlearned – or better yet – contested. According to French philosopher Jacques Derrida, deconstruction is a disruption to the conventional ways of seeing things – a break from the old-fashioned binary modes of thinking.
<br>
<br>
As a philosophy, deconstruction redefines the way we look at the world. We no longer see text as being superior to speech; a revolution for the equality of the sexes is ongoing as we speak; and gone are the days when emotion is perceived as irrelevant to societal relationships. 

        </p>
     
        <img class="blog-image2" src="../img/AboutUS/edited/architecture-ga4df2ede8_1920.jpg" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="carbon-text">
            Perhaps the same can be said of the opposition between creation and destruction. Rather than seeing creation and destruction as polar opposites, they can be seen as cooperative components in a more holistic and harmonious process. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But this breaking of binary oppositions is only the first step in the deconstructive method. The reason why we want to break these binaries is to demonstrate that structures are not set in stone and that, in fact, they can be broken. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This notion that structures are not set in stone and can therefore be broken into pieces is visible in several industries today. In gaming, the development of Virtual Reality (VR) technology allowed players to fully interact with the fictional components embedded within a game. No longer do we see a fixed opposition between reality and fiction, as such technology demonstrates; on the contrary, we see them intermingle with each other. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The opposition between big and small machines, where the “Bigger is better” slogan seemed to have originated is also evidently challenged. Smartphone companies appear to be aiming for more minimalist and compact mechanisms to sell in the market. Even in healthcare, nanotechnology reinforces the idea that tiny inventions can generate gigantic impacts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            These successes can be attributed to a courageous venture into the destruction of pre-established structures. The key is to start deconstructing systems.

            Decentralizing power
        </h3>

            When we think about the concept of a center, we think of a middle point within a network. Every point must pass through the center to get to the opposite pole. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Any legitimate business, for instance, has to pass through a central government in order to get his goods and services to his target consumers. Centralized systems are systems that involve this very middle point. It is no secret then that in such systems, the center holds a lot of power. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Decentralization in technology is all about the redistribution of power. When a system, let’s say, a banking system, is regulated by an external party, control is often compromised as a result of regulation. It is the middle point, the center, that profits out of the disproportion in power. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It is for this very reason that decentralization became widely celebrated in Silicon Valley, particularly those industries that utilize blockchain technology, from BitTorrent to Bitcoin, and more recently, non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 

        </p>

            In what is perhaps the most recognizable article in the cryptocurrency space, the anonymous author/s under the guises of the name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’, wrote that in Bitcoin “there is no central authority” that will issue the incentives for its transactions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having no central authority means that the transactions that take place within such a system can be purely peer-to-peer, removing the middle point. More importantly, in this system, control is redistributed to the peers within the network. In the blockchain technology in Bitcoin, the value of currency can be determined by the people - a historic first. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One can only imagine what other industries could potentially progress through the very act of removing centers and distributing powers.

            Democratizing knowledge

        <p class="carbon-text">
            Having a deconstructed system in place, combined with the decentralization of power, is already a strong start. The only thing left to do at this point is to identify proper channels for the acquisition of knowledge. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Knowledge is power. It not only satisfies our intellectual appetites and curiosities, but it can also be used as a means to get by in our practical lives. Knowing that the plate is hot prevents us from touching it. Knowing the trends in the stock market directly affects our trading decisions. Knowing the intricate details of a disease allows us to create measures that will eventually stop it from spreading. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When one knows, one is capable of turning that knowledge into action.
            <br>
            <br>
            The way to make this happen is through democratization. Democratization is all about celebrating freedom and access. A democratized platform is one that puts accessible mechanisms that maximize people’s freedoms in place. When knowledge is monopolized and deprived from the public, it makes it very difficult for people to maximize its use. After all, how can we use something that we don’t have access to? 
            <br>
            <br>
            In current affairs, democratization, as a process, has made its way onto the forefront of information sharing. YouTube is a very good example of a democratized platform where one can participate in a marketplace of ideas. Rather than serving as passive consumers, the participant can be both a viewer and a content creator. Even non-creators have the opportunity to engage in the creation process via the comment section and other engagement features.

        <p class="carbon-text">
            The same can be said about PC building cultures where freedom in customization had become of utmost priority. In the past, computers were not commercially available, and when they became so, they came with pre-existing components and features which were quite difficult to reverse-engineer.  
            <br>
            <br>
            These days, options to customize computers by handpicking their individual parts are accessible to consumers. People are given the freedom to not only use these computers, but to modify them according to their liking. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Democratized platforms give people the opportunity to know and be involved in the creation process. When we democratize, we allow freedom and access.

            Final Note
        </h3>
        <p class="carbon-text">
            The formula is simple but groundbreaking: Deconstruct systems, decentralize power, and democratize knowledge. 
            <br>
            <br>

       
            By <strong>deconstructing systems</strong>, we challenge the conventional structures that are in place, break them down, and build new ones. 
            <br>
            <br>
            By <strong>decentralizing power</strong>, we remove authority and redistribute control over to the hands of the people. 
            <br>
            <br>
            And by <strong>democratizing knowledge</strong>, we make information free and accessible to the public, and, consequently, involve them in the creation process.
