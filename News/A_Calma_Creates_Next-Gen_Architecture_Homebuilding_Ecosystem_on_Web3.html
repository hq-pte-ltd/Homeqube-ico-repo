                                        April 2022 – Jose Paolo Calma, hailing from the famed Filipino family of architects and contractors, has dedicated much of his life to the fast-paced, highly routine business of building houses.

                                        As CEO of interior construction pioneer Multi-Development & Construction Corporation (MDCC), he would chase one deadline after another while having his eyes open to the glaring flaws of the industry: long lead times, staggering inefficiencies in the design process, the overreliance on human labor, unsustainable raw materials, and not to mention the huge gap between e-commerce and the sector.

                                        “I wasn’t satisfied with how I delivered homes for the longest time. Human labor could only get you so far in quality and productivity. With all things on hold due to the pandemic, how will you build if all workers are gone? How will you address the shortage, the wasted time and resources?” said Calma, a finance, entrepreneurship, and construction engineering graduate from the De La Salle University, the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

                                    Aware of how the world has become more machine-oriented, he went on to launch a mobile app whose concept has long simmered in his mind: Homeqube, premised on making homebuilding accessible to all through a built-in network of manufacturers and the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology.

                                        Simplicity with robustness underscores Calma’s vision and industrialist outlook. Anyone with internet access can use the Homeqube app, start designing their future home via pre-programmed “Knobs” they can configure (the freemium version provides the first set of Knobs), and readily access information on cost, mobility and dynamics of home design and construction as well as procure home parts directly from verified manufacturers. 
                                  
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Calma emerges as a pioneer in this space as a decentralized online platform for homebuilding has not been done before, particularly in light of the long-term effects of global pandemics, climate change, and cybersecurity issues in the industry.

                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  
                                  Homeqube operates at the heart of Web3.0, where community-focused innovation powers the work of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) architecture, parametric design, digital fabrication, project automation, and smart contracting, to name a few. It makes a compelling offer to already successful contractors, according to Calma. 
                                  
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  The proposed ecosystem will also promote grassroots entrepreneurship due to the machine efficiencies of Web3 that built environment (BE) agents naturally work with. “Business is a continuous attrition, but working with Homeqube empowers manufacturers, suppliers, and formal and informal members of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) benefit from their stake more effectively along-side one another, across, and within,” he said.

                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  He cites the benefits of system architecture and automation instead of heavily depending on human output. As a result, a Homeqube community member can fully function as a homebuilder as they are able to make sense of the respective requirements through the “Knobs.”

                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Homeqube rides on the rapidly growing digital economy with the wealth of ways that users can engage in the app. Using the app’s standard QUBE token, users can design and earn tokens, join design game challenges, sell their designs as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) once they become community members, and even join the manufacturing network having their own e-shopfront of 3D printed parts to sell across app stakeholders.

                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  “Token exchange gamification are the basic ways we’re getting users to engage in the app. But the offer gets more exciting from there as it has a snowball effect on communal knowledge creation, where the true power of decentralization lies,” Calma said.

                                        “The world is fast creating increasingly decentralized, democratized, digital societies. If we can do this in small yet meaningful steps in homebuilding, in the longer term we will be able cover the housing shortage since this will be at least three times the speed of what we normally can cover in 10 years. In using eco-friendly composites, we can save dramatically slash carbon emission levels, making a better home building environment for everyone,” Calma said.

                                    The various forms of web3 materializing in the near future -- including decentralized social networks, play-to-earn (P2E) video games rewarding players with tokens, and NFT platforms for buying and selling digital assets -- are anticipated to transform homebuilding, upend its traditional gatekeepers, and usher in a middleman-free digital economy.

                                    Via novel technologies that augment, a mix of gamification and time-tested AEC logics has also become a viable way to DIY home design and building, effectively democratizing the project.
