                      <p class="card-text">The traditional process of constructing homes can be long, painful, and costly. The first step is to hire professionals to help you conceptualize and design your house. The next step is to apply for permits from a building official. Only upon its issuance can construction commence. The process for a typical two-storey home takes several months to complete without factoring in unforeseen events.
                        Homeqube can shorten lead time by using artificial intelligence, prefabrication, and easier parts

                      <p class="card-text">Architecture is one of the most difficult courses among all other courses. Aside from the exams, plates, thesis defence, and other college works, they need also at least two years of work experience before taking a licensure exam. The course is also expensive due to the learning materials, scale model projects, and other instruments used by architects. Combining these two aspects, obtaining the skills and knowledge in architecture is difficult.</p>

                        <br><br>
                        Homeqube will have a feature that connects the parts of your home to a recommended manufacturer. This shortens the canvassing process and helps to ensure that the materials requested

                  <p class="card-text">Steel and concrete are fundamental materials used in construction, but their production results in 4% of the global CO2 emissions. This greenhouse contributes to the increased rates of climate change, making them not environmentally friendly.

                    Homeqube parts designs use special composites, which are alternative structural materials to concrete and steel. Our calculation shows how these materials can lessen energy consumption and carbon emissions, thus making them eco-friendly.</p>

The typhoon Odette, the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines in 2021, damaged around 597,000 houses. While we can’t do anything about the inevitable severer weather, our company advocates for strong and resilient houses. The parts and assembly methods of Homeqube are proven and tested to withstand strong winds from up to 310kph, and earthquakes from up to 8.1 magnitudes.
